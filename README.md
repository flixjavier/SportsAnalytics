# Overview

As a software engineering student improving my skills, I created this project to practice Python fundamentals, data engineering, and statistical analysis. The goal of the project is to reinforce core concepts such as data manipulation with Pandas, merging complex datasets, calculating advanced sports metrics (Net Rating, True Shooting Percentage), and creating professional visualizations with Matplotlib.

This software is an NBA Team Performance Analyzer. It processes raw seasonal data from 2024 and 2025, merges team statistics with opponent statistics, and generates insights into team efficiency and dominance. It demonstrates Python's power for data science through automated data cleaning, relational merging, and correlation analysis.

# Development Environment
## Tools

  * Visual Studio Code (code editor)
  * Jupyter Notebooks / Python Scripting
  * Git for version control

## Platform
  * macOS (local development)

# Language and Libraries

  * Python 3
  * Pandas (for data manipulation and merging)
  * Matplotlib (for data visualization)
  * Pathlib (for robust file system management)
  * Numpy (for trend line calculations)

# Future features

Currently, the program manages data merging, calculates Net Rating and True Shooting Percentage (TS%), and generates scatter plots for offensive/defensive efficiency. The next features I would add are:
* **Predictive Modeling:** Use linear regression to predict end-of-season wins based on current Net Rating.
* **Player-Level Analysis:** Integrate player stats to see how individual performance impacts team TS%.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Use the Streamlit or Tkinter library to create a GUI where users can filter stats by team or season dynamically.
* **Automated PDF Reporting:** Generate a final summary report with all charts exported automatically.
